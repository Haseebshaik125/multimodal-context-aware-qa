# Multimodal Context-Aware Question Answering

Status: Ongoing (Research Project)

## Overview
This project explores multimodal AI systems that integrate text, image, and speech inputs to perform context-aware question answering.

The objective is to compare unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal architectures and analyze their performance, robustness, and efficiency.

## Current Phase
- Literature review
- Research question formulation
- Dataset analysis

## Planned Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformer-based Models
- Vision-Language Models (CLIP, ViLBERT)
- Speech Models (Whisper)

## Expected Outcomes
- Comparative analysis of multimodal fusion strategies
- Research-grade documentation
- Publication-ready report
